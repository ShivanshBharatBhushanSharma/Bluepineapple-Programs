Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is a festival celebrated in almost all parts of India. It is an Indian festival 
that marks the victory of good over bad (evil). It is a festival celebrated by Indians with great enthusiasm. The 
festival commemorates joy, harmony, and victory. It also marks the return of Lord Ram from exile, which is described 
in the epic Ramayana. 

Diwali is derived from the Sanskrit word Deepavali which means row of lights. So, this festival is celebrated by 
lighting lamps (usually earthen lamps) all around the house/office. It also symbolises light as the victory over 
darkness. Generally, according to the stars, the date for Diwali falls in October or November and is expected to be 
20 days after Dussehra. It is celebrated in the Hindu month called Kartika.
