        purposes. These people are called visitors (which may be either tourists or excursionists; 
        residents or non-residents) and tourism has to do with their activities, some of which involve 
        tourism expenditure.

        behaviors of people in preparation for and during a trip in their capacity as consumers

        Activity (principal): The principal activity of a producer unit is the activity whose value 
        added exceeds that of any other activity carried out within the same unit (SNA 2008, 5.8).

        Activity (productive): The (productive) activity carried out by a statistical unit is the type 
        of production in which it engages. It has to be understood as a process, i.e. the combination of 
        actions that result in a certain set of products. The classification of productive activities is 
        determined by their principal output.

Administrative data: Administrative data is the set of units and data derived from an administrative source. This is a data holding information collected and maintained for the purpose of implementing one or more administrative regulations.

Aggregated data: The result of transforming unit level data into quantitative measures for a set of characteristics of a population.

Aggregation: A process that transforms microdata into aggregate-level information by using an aggregation function such as count, sum average, standard deviation, etc.

Analytical unit: Entity created by statisticians, by splitting or combining observation units with the help of estimations and imputations.

Balance of payments: The balance of payments is a statistical statement that summarizes transactions between residents and non-residents during a period. It consists of the goods and services account, the primary income account, the secondary income account, the capital account, and the financial account (BPM6, 2.12).

Bias: An effect which deprives a statistical result of representativeness by systematically distorting it, as distinct from a random error which may distort on any one occasion but balances out on the average.

Business and professional purpose (of a tourism trip): The business and professional purpose of a tourism trip includes the activities of the self-employed and employees, as long as they do not correspond to an implicit or explicit employer-employee relationship with a resident producer in the country or place visited, those of investors, businessmen, etc. (IRTS 2008, 3.17.2).

Business visitor: A business visitor is a visitor whose main purpose for a tourism trip corresponds to the business and professional category of purpose (IRTS 2008, 3.17.2).

Central Product Classification: The Central Product Classification (CPC) constitutes a complete product classification covering goods and services. It is intended to serve as an international standard for assembling and tabulating all kinds of data requiring product detail, including industrial production, national accounts, service industries, domestic and foreign commodity trade, international trade in services, balance of payments, consumption and price statistics. Other basic aims are to provide a framework for international comparison and promote harmonization of various types of statistics dealing with goods and services.

Census: A census is the complete enumeration of a population or groups at a point in time with respect to well defined characteristics: for example, Population, Production, Traffic on particular roads.

Coherence: Adequacy of statistics to be combined in different ways and for various uses.

Consistency: Logical and numerical coherence.

Country of reference: The country of reference refers to the country for which the measurement is done. (IRTS 2008, 2.15).

Country of residence: The country of residence of a household is determined according to the centre of predominant economic interest of its members. If a person resides (or intends to reside) for more than one year in a given country and has there his/her centre of economic interest (for example, where the predominant amount of time is spent), he/she is considered as a resident of this country.

Country-specific tourism characteristic products and activities: To be determined by each country by applying the criteria of IRTS 2008, 5.10 in their own context; for these products, the activities producing them will be considered as tourism characteristic, and the industries in which the principal activity is tourism-characteristic will be called tourism industries (IRTS 2008, 5.16).

Data checking: Activity whereby the correctness conditions of the data are verified. It also includes the specification of the type of error or of the condition not met, and the qualification of the data and their division into “error-free data” and “erroneous data”.

Data collection: Systematic process of gathering data for official statistics.

Data compilation: Operations performed on data to derive new information according to a given set of rules.

Data confrontation: The process of comparing data that has generally been derived from different surveys or other sources, especially those of different frequencies, in order to assess and possibly improve their coherency, and identify the reasons for any differences.

Data processing: Data processing is the operation performed on data by the organization, institute, agency, etc., responsible for undertaking the collection, tabulation, manipulation and preparation of data and metadata output.

Data reconciliation: The process of adjusting data derived from two different sources to remove, or at least reduce, the impact of differences identified.

        The Ministry of Tourism has launched the “Incredible India 2.0” Campaign which marks a shift 
        from generic promotions across the world to market specific promotional plans and content 
        creation. The Campaign covers the important source markets for Indian tourism and also takes 
        into account emerging markets with significant potential. The focus of the campaign is on 
        increased Digital presence through mass reach portals, specific genres and social media and 
        Television as a medium due to the large reach offered. Thematic television commercials and 
        creatives have been produced as part of the campaign.
