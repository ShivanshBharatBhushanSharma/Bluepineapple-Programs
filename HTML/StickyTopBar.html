        Tourism is a social, cultural and economic phenomenon which entails the movement of people to 
        countries or places outside their usual environment for personal or business/professional 
        purposes. These people are called visitors (which may be either tourists or excursionists; 
        residents or non-residents) and tourism has to do with their activities, some of which involve 
        tourism expenditure.

        Activity/activities: In tourism statistics, the term activities represent the actions and 
        behaviors of people in preparation for and during a trip in their capacity as consumers 
        (IRTS 2008, 1.2).

        The Ministry of Tourism has launched the “Incredible India 2.0” Campaign which marks a shift 
        from generic promotions across the world to market specific promotional plans and content 
        creation. The Campaign covers the important source markets for Indian tourism and also takes 
        into account emerging markets with significant potential. The focus of the campaign is on 
        increased Digital presence through mass reach portals, specific genres and social media and 
        Television as a medium due to the large reach offered. Thematic television commercials and 
        creatives have been produced as part of the campaign.
